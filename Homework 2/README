DecisionTree.py

In order to implement the gain_info and gain_ratio missing code, I simply referenced the slides and filled in the 
corresponding code segments. In order to pick a leaf in the missing code segments, all of the leaves are the 
same value, so I chose the first one.

svm.py

In order to implement the missing functions, I once again referenced the slides. I implemented the non-linear 
functionality by filling a kernel matrix using two nested loops, and then multiplying by the corresponding 
alpha and y values.
